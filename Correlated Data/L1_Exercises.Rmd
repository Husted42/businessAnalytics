This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
lbw <- read.table("~/Downloads/lbw.txt", header = 1)
lbw$bwt<- as.numeric(lbw$bwt)
lbw$race <- as.factor(lbw$race)
lbw$smoke <- as.factor(lbw$smoke)
lbw
```

```{r}
addmargins(table(lbw$smoke,lbw$race)) #see the distribution of the observations.

###### ----- Boxplot ----- ######
# Boxplot with interaction between race and smoke
boxplot(bwt ~ smoke:race, data = lbw,
        xlab = "Race and Smoke", ylab = "Birth weight",
        las = 1)

# Compute group means
means2 <- tapply(lbw$bwt, interaction(lbw$smoke, lbw$race), mean)

# Add points for group means
points(1:6, means2, pch = 23, cex = 0.75, bg = "red")

###### ----- Scatter ----- ######
stripchart(
  bwt~smoke:race, data=lbw, vertical=TRUE, method="jitter", xlab="Smoke/Race",
  ylab="Birth weight",pch=16,cex=.75, las=1, col=2:4)
points(1:6, means2, pch = 17, cex = 1.5, col = "black")

$$ y_i = \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + e_i $$

Fit a linear model with interaction between the two factors race and
smoke. Test whether the interaction term is statistically significan
```{r}
# Race, smoke and their interaction
# m1 <- lm(bwt ~ race + smoke + race:smoke - 1, data = lbw)
m1 <- lm(bwt ~ race + smoke + race:smoke, data = lbw)

# The term race:smoke has a p-value of 0.1 so the interaction is not significant
anova(m1)

m2 <- lm(bwt ~ race + smoke, data = lbw)
drop1(m2, test = 'F')
summary(m2)

```

```{r}
# Man kan ikke se det i R-output, men den plotter begge funktioner ved siden af hindanden nÃ¥r man har knit'et
plot(fitted(m2), rstandard(m2))
abline(0,0, col = 'Red')

qqnorm(rstandard(m2))
abline(0,1, lty=2)
```

We see that the residuals is normal distributed


```{r}
